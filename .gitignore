.dockerignore # Usually you want to commit this, but can be ignored if generated
!.dockerignore # Ensure .dockerignore is NOT ignored if it's part of the project setup

# If you build images locally and don't want to commit them
# *.tar.gz # If you save images as tarballs locally
# *.docker # Docker image files

# --- Kubernetes ---

# Local Kubeconfig files (SHOULD NOT BE COMMITTED if they contain sensitive cluster access)
# Be very careful with these. It's generally better to manage kubeconfig outside the repo.
# kubeconfig
# .kube/config
# *.kubeconfig

# Generated manifests if they are built from templates and shouldn't be versioned directly
# (e.g., if you use kustomize overlays that are then built)
# kustomize/dist/
# generated-manifests/

# --- Helm ---

# Helm chart packages
*.tgz

# Helm chart dependency directory (managed by `helm dependency update`)
charts/ # If this directory is used for downloaded dependencies
# If you have your own subcharts in `charts/` that ARE part of your project,
# then do NOT ignore `charts/`. Instead, you might ignore specific tgz files within it:
# charts/*.tgz

# Temporary chart build files
tmpcharts/

# Helm chart lock files (if you prefer not to commit them, though often they are)
# requirements.lock
# Chart.lock

# --- Secrets & Sensitive Data ---
# Add any files that contain secrets, API keys, passwords, etc.
# It's best practice to use a secrets management system instead of committing secrets.
